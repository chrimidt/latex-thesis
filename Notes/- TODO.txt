Background:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Adam optimizer
- Logit adjustment
- Make figures
- Detailed architecture of ResNet-50
- Detailed architecture of MobileNetV2
- Detailed architectire of ViT-B/16
- Detailed architecture of ConvNeXt

- Remove the long-tailed category figure

Methodology:
- Read all notes from earlier
- Make plot of ImageNet distribution into bar plot
x Model Selection
- Loss Selection
- Explain choice of optimizer
- Find the reference that says adam optimizer doesnt work with certain losses: Long-tail learning via logit adjustment
- Explain freezing layers
- Insert the results from the reference papers for the models and losses 

Experimental Setup:
- Rephrasing
- Check for redundancy

Results and Discussion:
x Compare models to state-of-the-art for CIFAR100 on paperswithcode.com
x Write the differences from my experiments and their experiments
x Why is middle class lower than head an tail classes
x Investigate why Class-Balanced loss is so bad 
x What is the best method and compare to the others
x How should the methods be compared in order to find the best method 
x Move comparisons with state-of-the-art results in seperate section.
- Calculate variance of the mean of the loss functions (fig 5.6)
- Describe the kernel and stride size of ViT-B/16 and how it affects the results on the 32x32 cifar-100
- Find the kernel and stride sizes for other ViT-B/16 trained with CIFAR-100
- Confusion matrix?
- Table for the mean and standard deviation across all loss designs for each model in figure 5.1
- Include the new found CBL and SEQL 
- Compare the types of class re-balancing
