Background:
x Convolutional Neural Networks
x Adam optimizer
x Logit adjustment
x Loss preliminaries (probabilities)
x Make figures
x Sort out sections
x Remove the long-tailed category figure
x Re-arrange model architecture sections
x K classes 
x label shift

Methodology:
x Model Selection
x Loss Selection
x Explain choice of optimizer
x Find the reference that says adam optimizer doesnt work with certain losses: Long-tail learning via logit adjustment
x Explain freezing layers
x Parameters in model table
- Align the selection to the background theory
- Make the arguments simpler

Experimental Setup:
x Rephrasing
x Check for redundancy

Results and Discussion:
x Compare models to state-of-the-art for CIFAR100 on paperswithcode.com
x Write the differences from my experiments and their experiments
x Why is middle class lower than head an tail classes
x Investigate why Class-Balanced loss is so bad 
x What is the best method and compare to the others
x How should the methods be compared in order to find the best method 
x Move comparisons with state-of-the-art results in seperate section.
x Table for the mean and standard deviation across all loss designs for each model in figure 5.1
x Include the new found CBL and SEQL 
x Compare the types of class re-balancing
