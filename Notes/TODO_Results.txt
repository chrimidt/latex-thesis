To do list for the Results and Discussion section.

x Make bar plots of figures 5.3 - 5.6
x Make box plot of figure 5.9 (bar plot instead)
x Delete figure 5.7
x Make a table for the mean and standard deviation
- Make table for the mean and std dev for models
x Include Benchmark results in the tables
- Begin an appendix for the benchmark comparisons
- Write about the findings compared to the baseline
- Include the list of things in the summary and discussion section
x Correct ResNet50V2 to ResNet50
- Make bar plot of mean + std for models

- Hvis jeg finder long-tailed metoderne testet på cifar-100-lt, sæt dem ind i en tabel, og så inkluder backbone.

- Mention that balanced softmax performs better on middle and tail classes overall, but other methods perform better on head classes.
