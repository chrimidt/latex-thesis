% Chapter 6: Conclusion and Future Work

Summary of the work, contributions, and suggestions for future improvements or research directions.

\section{Revisiting the Goals of the Thesis}
The goal of this thesis was to investigate the impact of loss functions combined with different backbones trained with long-tailed datasets in order to see the impact of the different methods on tail-class accuracy. 


\section{Future Work}
Conduct experiments on ImageNet or other larger datasets. Train ViT-B/16 with larger dataset and change some of the parameters.

Train CIFAR-100-LT with LDAM-DRW and different loss functions.
