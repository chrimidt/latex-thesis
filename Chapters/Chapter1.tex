This thesis focuses on the problem with long-tailed datasets. The problem with training a deep learning model on long-tailed datasets is that the model will effectively 
the data from the classes with most samples, and not the classes with few samples. The finsihed model will then not recognize an input from the tail classes. Most real-world
datasets follows a long-tailed structure, hence the need for a reliable method to detect examples of tail-class data. The aim of this thesis is to try out some of the methods tackling the long-tailed problem for deep learning described in the paper \textit{Deep Long-Tailed Learning: A Survey} by Zhang et al.\cite{zhang2023deep} to find a method for long-tailed learning that works on a specific long-tailed dataset of images of moths taken around equator. The goal of the moth dataset is to identify species.
