This thesis focuses on the problem with long-tailed datasets. The problem with training a deep learning model on long-tailed datasets is that the model will effectively 
the data from the classes with most samples, and not the classes with few samples. The finsihed model will then not recognize an input from the tail classes. Most real-world
datasets follows a long-tailed structure, hence the need for a reliable method to detect examples of tail-class data. The aim of this thesis is to try out some of the methods tackling the long-tailed problem for deep learning described in the paper \textit{Deep Long-Tailed Learning: A Survey} by Zhang et al.\cite{zhang2023deep} to find a method for long-tailed learning that works on a specific long-tailed dataset of images of moths taken around equator. The goal of the moth dataset is to identify species.

\section{Problem Definition}
Define the problem formally, including key terms like "head classes" and "tail classes."
Provide an example or visualization of a long-tailed dataset.
Connect the problem definition to the moth dataset.

\subsection{Goals of this thesis}
Clearly outline the goals of the thesis, emphasizing measurable or specific objectives (e.g., evaluate certain methods, optimize performance on tail classes, etc.).
Mention how these goals contribute to the field of long-tailed learning.

\subsection{Approach}
Briefly summarize the approach to achieve goals, such as implementing and comparing methods from Zhang et al.â€™s survey.
% Highlight any novel aspects of the work (e.g., unique dataset, evaluation framework, or combination of methods).

\subsection{Scope of this thesis}
Specify the scope to manage reader expectations. For example:
Focus is on image classification, not other tasks like object detection.
Methods are tested on a specific dataset, not generalized across all domains.
The evaluation is limited to certain metrics (like F1 score) and does not cover deployment concerns.

\section{Motivation}
Deepen the discussion on why the problem is significant, including real-world implications.
Mention the importance of biodiversity studies or the challenges of species identification with limited samples.
Discuss broader impacts, such as how solving long-tailed learning problems can benefit other fields.
