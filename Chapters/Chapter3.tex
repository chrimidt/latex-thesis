% Chapter 3: Methodology

This chapter describes the methods and approaches used in the experiments. This includes dataset preparation, models, loss functions, etc.

\section{Overview of Methodology Approach}
An overall description of the approach to tackling the long-tailed dataset problem, including an explanation of the strategy, 
such as balancing techniques and model selection.

\section{Algorithm Selection and Rationale}
Description of the model architectures chosen, and why they are appropriate for long-tailed learning.
Discussion of the strengths and limitations of these models in addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced data.

\section{Long-tailed Learning Techniques}
Description of the specific methods used to address class imbalance, such as data sampling, class re-weighting, etc. 
Justification for selecting these techniques, potentially referencing prior research (from Deep Long-Tailed Learning: A Survey by Zhang et al.).

% \subsection{Arguments}
% The reason the focus has been on class-sensistive learning form the re-balancing methods, is that re-sampling comes with challenges regarding knowing the dataset prior to training the model. we want to find the best method for classifying the moth dataset, on which we have no ability to test. TODO: this might not be the case. 

\section{Loss Functions}
Explanation of the different loss functions explored, such as cross-entropy, focal loss, LDAM loss, etc., and their relevance for long-tailed learning.
Rationale for each loss function's inclusion, focusing on its expected benefits for imbalanced classes and how it addresses the bias toward majority classes.

\section{Data Imbalance Handling Strategies}
Detailed explanation of the techniques for creating and handling an imbalanced dataset, such as generating imbalanced training and test sets.


\section{Evaluation Strategies}
Justification for the metrics and evaluation approach, such as using weighted or macro F1 scores.
Explanation of how the performance is assessed across different class groups to capture the modelâ€™s performance on minority classes.

\section{Implementation Details}
Technical explanations of any unique or customized methods implemented in code, for example the custom dataset.
