\todo{Comment on \ref{fig:mobilenet_bal_loss_comparison}.}

From Table \ref{tab:mobilenet_bal_acc1_1}, the overall best performance on MobileNetV2 trained with a balanced CIFAR100 training dataset is achieved by Balanced Softmax Loss, which has the highest accuracy on the balanced test dataset (Acc1: 0.8034), as well as on the head (Acc1: 0.8069) and tail (Acc1: 0.9211) classes, with only slightly worse performance on the middle classes in comparison. Among all loss functions, LDAM Loss shows the lowest overall performance on the balanced test set (Acc1: 0.7828) and the long-tailed test set (Acc1: 0.7821), except for its strong performance on tail classes (Acc1: 0.9211). % This highlights LDAM’s specialized focus on tail classes at the cost of performance on head and middle classes.

Softmax Loss, Weighted Softmax Loss, and Class-Balanced Loss yield the same accuracies across all test datasets, likely due to their similarities in loss design  \todo{Refer to background section}.

Balanced Softmax Loss, Equalization Loss, and LDAM Loss exhibit the highest accuracy on tail classes (Acc1: 0.9211). Despite their differing loss designs, this convergence in accuracy suggests that the dataset's tail-class performance may have reached a plateau, possibly due to the inherent characteristics of the tail classes, i.e. either noise or the limited number of samples available per class in the tail \todo{Refer to background section}.

A similar trend is observed in the middle-class accuracy, where Softmax, Focal Loss, Weighted Softmax Loss, and Class-Balanced Loss all achieve identical results (Acc1: 0.7870). Similarly, for head classes, Softmax, Weighted Softmax Loss, Class-Balanced Loss, and Balanced Softmax Loss perform equally well, achieving the highest accuracy (Acc1: 0.8069). % hinting at saturation. This consistency across different loss functions on the balanced dataset could be due to their shared design principles.

% TODO: Compare results to related studies of MobileNetV2 trained on CIFAR100 [table \ref{tab:comparison_mobilenet}]. Mention that the results from MobileNetV2 on the balanced CIFAR100 are okay but not the greatest.




% However, because balanced softmax loss does not yield the same result on both the balanced test set and the long-tailed test set as the other three mentioned, it is likely due to a saturation in the head classes. The softmax loss, weighted softmax loss, and class-balanced loss all yield the same performance across test sets, showing their similiarity in loss design on a balanced training dataset. The best perfoming loss function on the balanced test set is the weighted softmax loss (Acc1: 0.8034), however this is not the best performing loss function on the complete long-tailed dataset, but it has the best accuracy on tail classes (Acc1: 0.9211), and comparable performance on head and tail classes. Except for the performance on tail classes, the overall worst performing loss method is the LDAM loss, with accuracy of 0.7828 on a balanced test set, and 0.7821 on a long-tailed test set. Compared to the baseline, the softmax loss, that has an accuracy of 0.7978 on the balanced test set, and 0.8059 on the long-tailed test set.


% Balanced Softmax Loss, however, stands out due to its differentiated performance across datasets. Unlike Softmax, Weighted Softmax Loss, and Class-Balanced Loss, which yield consistent results across balanced and long-tailed datasets, Balanced Softmax achieves a higher accuracy on tail classes while showing slight variability in overall performance. This suggests that Balanced Softmax is more sensitive to class-specific adjustments, particularly in imbalanced scenarios.


% 
% Compared to the baseline Softmax Loss (balanced: Acc1: 0.7978, long-tailed: Acc1: 0.8059), Balanced Softmax Loss demonstrates slightly better performance on the balanced dataset but shows more variability on the long-tailed dataset, where it achieves comparable results on tail classes but lower performance overall.

\todo{Comment on figure \ref{fig:mobilenet_lt_loss_comparison}.}

From table \ref{tab:mobilenet_lt_acc1_1}, the best overall performance on MobileNetV2 trained with a long-tailed CIFAR100 training dataset is achieved by Balanced Softmax Loss, with the highest accuracy on the balanced test set (Acc1: 0.5796), middle classes (Acc1: 0.6331), and tail classes (Acc1: 0.4211), and with competing accuracies on the long-tailed test dataset (Acc1: 0.7650) and head classes (Acc1: 0.8069), with the highest performance of Focal Loss with top-1 accuracies of 0.7745 and 0.8389, respectively.

The Class-Balanced loss exhibits the least satisfactory accuracies across all test dataset (Balanced: 0.1936, Long-Tailed: 0.0913, Head: 0.0521, Middle: 0.2485), with the only exception at tail classes (Acc1: 0.2632), where the results are comparable to those of other loss designs. This is a contrast to the performance when trained with a balanced CIFAR100 dataset, where the loss design performed within range of the other loss designs, possibly indicating a fault in implementation \todo{investigate implementation}.

Unlike the performance of loss functions trained on the balanced CIFAR100, there are not as many incidents of accuracies of the same value, except for the performance of Softmax Loss, Focal Loss, and Equalization loss on middle classes (Acc1: 0.5917). However, this value is not the highest, as the Balanced Softmax Loss achieves a top-1 accuracy of 0.6331. \todo{explain this.}

From table \ref{tab:resnet_bal_acc1_1}, there are three loss designs with the best perfomance on the balanced test dataset, namely Softmax Loss, Weighted Softmax Loss, and Class-Balanced Loss (Acc1: 0.8324). Furthermore, they all yeild the same results across all test dataset due to their cross-entropy architecture for balanced training data. Likewise they yield the best perfomance on the tail classes along with equalization loss (Acc1: 0.9474) \todo{explain}. % possibly due to the low number of samples in the tail classes.

The perfomance of the Balanced Softmax Loss shows excellence on the long-tailed dataset (Acc1: 0.8430) as well as the head classes (Acc1: 0.8460) with competing results on both middle (Acc1: 0.8107) and tail (Acc1: 0.9211) classes.

The worst performance is that of the LDAM loss across all test datasets.

The best performance on the long-tailed dataset and head classes was presented by the Softmax Loss (Acc1: 0.7954, 0.8531).

Two loss designs are competing for the worst performance with underwhelming results across all test datasets, namely the Class-Balanced loss and the LDAM loss. The LDAM loss achieved an accuracy of 0.0789 on the tail classes, while remaining stable, but unsatisfactory on the rest. The Class-balanced loss with the highest accuracy of 0.3787 across all test datasets has a performance of negligence.

\end{table}

From table \ref{tab:conv_bal_acc1_1}, the best performance on the balanced test dataset is achieved by the Balanced Softmax Loss (Acc1: 0.8364), while also achieving the best result on the tail classes (Acc1: 0.9474).

Not surprisingly, the Softmax loss, Weighted Softmax loss, and Class-balanced loss exhibits the same performance across all test dataset, as they were trained with the balanced training dataset, and their designs reduces to the Softmax loss. These three loss function exhibit the best performance on the long-tailed dataset (0.8535), head classes (Acc1: 0.8566) and tail classes (Acc1: 0.9474). The best performance on middle classes is achieved my the Equalization loss (Acc1: 0.8343).

Five out of six loss design achieve the same performance on the tail classes, likely due to saturation causes by the limited number of samples and noise.

\todo{Explain why balanced softmax could achieve higher accuracy in the balanced dataset.}

    \label{tab:conv_lt_acc1_1}
\end{table}

From table \ref{tab:conv_lt_acc1_1} the best performance on a balanced test dataset is achived by the Balanced Softmax loss (Acc1: 0.6460), which was the same for the ConvNeXt Base trained with the balanced CIFAR100. See table \ref{tab:conv_bal_acc1_1}. Likewise, the Balanced Softmax loss performs with the highest accuracy on the tail classes (Acc1: 0.5789), far exceeding the second highest performance, achieved by Equalization loss (Acc1: 0.3421). The highest accuracy on the long-tailed dataset (Acc1: 0.8316), as well as the head classes (Acc1: 0.8898), is achieved by the Softmax Loss, while Equalization Loss performs with highest accuracy on middle classes (Acc1: 0.6923). In comparison, the Balanced Softmax loss is third in accuracy on the long-tailed dataset, head classes, as well as middle classes. 

Noticably, both Softmax loss and focal loss performs with equal accuracies on both middle (Acc1: 0.6568) and tail classes (Acc1: 0.3158), but not elsewhere. \todo{give a reason why that might be.}

The worst performance is achieved by the Class-Balanced loss, with accuracies far below the second worst performances. The Class-balanced loss should be disregarded for training with a long-tailed dataset, as it is most likely a fault in implementation. \todo{investigate this and return to this conclusion.}
